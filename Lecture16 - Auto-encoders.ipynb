    "**Autoencoder** is a neural network designed to learn an identity function in an unsupervised way  to reconstruct the original input while compressing the data in the process so as to discover a more efficient and compressed representation. The idea was originated in [the 1980s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder), and later promoted by the seminal paper by [Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c50d/ca78e97e335d362d6b991ae0e1448914e9a3.pdf).\n",

A good intermediate representation not only can capture latent variables, but also benefits a full [decompression](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/09/image-compression-with-neural-networks.html) process.\n",

Thus, we assume that each feature is a guassian distribiution and their combination which creates the hidden representation is a multivariate guassian.From a probabilistic graphical models prespective, an auto encoder can be seen as a directed graphical model where the hidden units are latent variables ($z$) and the following rule applies:\n",
