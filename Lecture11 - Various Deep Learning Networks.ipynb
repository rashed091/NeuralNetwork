    "In our first encounter with image data we applied a [Multilayer Perceptron](../chapter_deep-learning-basics/mlp-scratch.md) to pictures of clothing in the Fashion-MNIST data set. Both the height and width of each image were 28 pixels. We expanded the pixels in the image line by line to get a vector of length 784, and then used them as inputs to the fully connected layer. However, this classification method has certain limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The adjacent pixels in the same column of an image may be far apart in this vector. The patterns they create may be difficult for the model to recognize. In fact, the vectorial representation ignores position entirely - we could have permuted all $28 \\times 28$ pixels at random and obtained the same results.\n",
    "2. For large input images, using a fully connected layer can easily cause the model to become too large, as we discussed previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the previous sections, the convolutional layer attempts to solve both problems. On the one hand, the convolutional layer retains the input shape, so that the correlation of image pixels in the directions of both height and width can be recognized effectively. On the other hand, the convolutional layer repeatedly calculates the same kernel and the input of different positions through the sliding window, thereby avoiding excessively large parameter sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional neural network is a network with convolutional layers. In this section, we will introduce an early convolutional neural network used to recognize handwritten digits in images - [LeNet5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/). Convolutional networks were invented by Yann LeCun and coworkers at AT&T Bell Labs in the early 90s. LeNet showed that it was possible to use gradient descent to train the convolutional neural network for handwritten digit recognition. It achieved outstanding results at the time (only matched by Support Vector Machines at the time).\n",
    "\n",
    "## LeNet\n",
    "\n",
    "LeNet is divided into two parts: a block of convolutional layers and one of fully connected ones. Below, we will introduce these two modules separately. Before going into details, let's briefly review the model in pictures. To illustrate the issue of channels and the specific layers we will use a rather description (later we will see how to convey the same information more concisely).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/lenet.svg\" alt=\"\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic units in the convolutional block are a convolutional layer and a subsequent average pooling layer (note that max-pooling works better, but it had not been invented in the 90s yet). The convolutional layer is used to recognize the spatial patterns in the image, such as lines and the parts of objects, and the subsequent average pooling layer is used to reduce the dimensionality. The convolutional layer block is composed of repeated stacks of these two basic units. In the convolutional layer block, each convolutional layer uses a $5\\times 5$ window and a sigmoid activation function for the output (note that ReLU works better, but it had not been invented in the 90s yet). The number of output channels for the first convolutional layer is 6, and the number of output channels for the second convolutional layer is increased to 16. This is because the height and width of the input of the second convolutional layer is smaller than that of the first convolutional layer. Therefore, increasing the number of output channels makes the parameter sizes of the two convolutional layers similar. The window shape for the two average pooling layers of the convolutional layer block is $2\\times 2$ and the stride is 2. Because the pooling window has the same shape as the stride, the areas covered by the pooling window sliding on each input do not overlap. In other words, the pooling layer performs downsampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output shape of the convolutional layer block is (batch size, channel, height, width). When the output of the convolutional layer block is passed into the fully connected layer block, the fully connected layer block flattens each example in the mini-batch. That is to say, the input shape of the fully connected layer will become two dimensional: the first dimension is the example in the mini-batch, the second dimension is the vector representation after each example is flattened, and the vector length is the product of channel, height, and width.  The fully connected layer block has three fully connected layers. They have 120, 84, and 10 outputs, respectively. Here, 10 is the number of output classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we implement the LeNet model through the Sequential class."

    "## AlexNet\n",
    "\n",
    "AlexNet was introduced in 2012, named after Alex Krizhevsky, the first author of the eponymous [paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks). AlexNet uses an 8-layer convolutional neural network and won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 with a large margin. This network proved, for the first time, that the features obtained by learning can transcend manually-design features, breaking the previous paradigm in computer vision. The architectures of AlexNet and LeNet are *very similar*, as the diagram below illustrates. Note that we provide a slightly streamlined version of AlexNet which removes the quirks that were needed in 2012 to make the model fit on two small GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/alexnet-all.svg\" alt=\"\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The design philosophies of AlexNet and LeNet are very similar, but there are also significant differences.\n",
    "First, AlexNet is much deeper than the comparatively small LeNet5. AlexNet consists of eight layers, five convolutional layers, two fully connected hidden layers, and one fully connected output layer. Second, AlexNet used the ReLU instead of the sigmoid as its activation function. This improved convergence during training significantly. Let's delve into the details below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In AlexNet's first layer, the convolution window shape is $11\\times11$. Since most images in ImageNet are more than ten times higher and wider than the MNIST images, objects in ImageNet images take up more pixels. Consequently, a larger convolution window is needed to capture the object. The convolution window shape in the second layer is reduced to $5\\times5$, followed by $3\\times3$. In addition, after the first, second, and fifth convolutional layers, the network adds maximum pooling layers with a window shape of $3\\times3$ and a stride of 2. Moreover, AlexNet has ten times more convolution channels than LeNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the last convolutional layer are two fully connected layers with 4096 outputs. These two huge fully connected layers produce model parameters of nearly 1 GB. Due to the limited memory in early GPUs, the original AlexNet used a dual data stream design, so that one GPU only needs to process half of the model. Fortunately, GPU memory has developed tremendously over the past few years, so we usually do not need this special design anymore (our model deviates from the original paper in this aspect).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, AlexNet changed the sigmoid activation function to a simpler ReLU activation function. On the one hand, the computation of the ReLU activation function is simpler. For example, it does not have the exponentiation operation found in the sigmoid activation function. On the other hand, the ReLU activation function makes model training easier when using different parameter initialization methods. This is because, when the output of the sigmoid activation function is very close to 0 or 1, the gradient of these regions is almost 0, so that back propagation cannot continue to update some of the model parameters. In contrast, the gradient of the ReLU activation function in the positive interval is always 1. Therefore, if the model parameters are not properly initialized, the sigmoid function may obtain a gradient of almost 0 in the positive interval, so that the model cannot be effectively trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capacity Control and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "AlexNet controls the model complexity of the fully connected layer by [dropout](../chapter_deep-learning-basics/dropout.md) section), while LeNet only uses weight decay. To augment the data even further, the training loop of AlexNet added a great deal of image augmentation, such as flipping, clipping, and color changes. This makes the model more robust and the larger sample size effectively reduces overfitting. We will discuss preprocessing in detail in a [subsequent section](../chapter_computer-vision/image-augmentation.md)."

    "## VGG Network\n",

Although AlexNet proved that deep convolutional neural networks can achieve good results, it does not provide simple rules to guide subsequent researchers in the design of new networks. In the following sections, we will introduce several different concepts used in deep network design.\n",

This led to the VGG network, which we will be discussing below. When using a modern deep learning framework repeated structures can be expressed as *code* with for loops and subroutines.

Throughout their design [Simonyan and Ziserman, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) used convolution windows of size 3 and maximum pooling with stride and window width 2, effectively halving the resolution after each block.

    "LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG all share a common design pattern: extract the spatial features through a sequence of convolutions and pooling layers and then post-process the representations via fully connected layers. The improvements upon LeNet by AlexNet and VGG mainly lie in how these later networks widen and deepen these two modules. An alternative is to use fully connected layers much earlier in the process. However, a careless use of a dense layer would destroy the spatial structure of the data entirely, since fully connected layers mangle all inputs. Network in Network (NiN) blocks offer an alternative. They were proposed by [Lin, Chen and Yan, 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.4400.pdf) based on a very simple insight - to use an MLP on the channels for each pixel separately.\n",

But we could apply a fully connected layer at a pixel level: Recall the $1\\times 1$ convolutional layer described in the section discussing [channels](channels.md). This somewhat unusual convolution can be thought of as a fully connected layer processing channel activations on a per pixel level. Another way to view this is to think of each element in the spatial dimension (height and width) as equivalent to an example, and the channel as equivalent to a feature. NiNs use the $1\\times 1$ convolutional layer instead of a fully connected layer. The spatial information can then be naturally passed to the subsequent layers.

Here, the global average pooling layer, i.e. the window shape, is equal to the average pooling layer of the input spatial dimension shape. The advantage of NiN's design is that it can significantly reduce the size of model parameters, thus mitigating overfitting. In other words, short of the average pooling all operations are convolutions. However, this design sometimes results in an increase in model training time."

It is important to note here that this transformation is strictly linear, but in most of application of 1x1 convolution, it is succeeded by a non-linear activation layer like ReLU. This transformation is learned through the (stochastic) gradient descent. But an important distinction is that it suffers with less over-fitting due to smaller kernel size (1x1).\n",

In a way, it can be seen as \"going wide\" instead of \"deep\", but it should be noted that in machine learning terminology, 'going wide' is often meant as adding more data to the training. Combination of 1x1 (x F) convolution is mathematically equivalent to a multi-layer perceptron.[[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3oln72/1x1_convolutions_why_use_them/cvyxood)]. \n",

Let's assume that $f^*$ is the function that we really would like to find. If it's in $\\mathcal{F}$, we're in good shape but typically we won't be quite so lucky.

However, if $\\mathcal{F} \\not\\subseteq \\mathcal{F}'$ there is no guarantee that this should even happen. In fact, $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}'}$ might well be worse.

This is the question that He et al, 2016 considered when working on very deep computer vision models. At the heart of ResNet is the idea that every additional layer should contain the identity function as one of its elements. This means that if we can train the newly-added layer into an identity mapping $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}$, the new model will be as effective as the original model. As the new model may get a better solution to fit the training data set, the added layer might make it easier to reduce training errors. Even better, the identity function rather than the null $f(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$ should be the the simplest function within a layer. \n",

This can be tricky if we don't need that particular layer and we would much rather retain the input $\\mathbf{x}$. The portion within the dotted-line box in the right image now only needs to parametrize the *deviation* from the identity, since we return $\\mathbf{x} + f(\\mathbf{x})$. In practice, the residual mapping is often easier to optimize. We only need to set $f(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$. The right image in the figure below illustrates the basic Residual Block of ResNet.

Then, we skip these two convolution operations and add the input directly before the final ReLU activation function. This kind of design requires that the output of the two convolutional layers be of the same shape as the input, so that they can be added together.

    "After each convolution (weight) layer a batch normalization method (BN) is adopted. The training of the network is achiebed by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a mini-batch size of 256. The learning rate starts from 0.1 and is divided by 10 when the error plateaus. The weight decay rate is 0.0001 and has a value of 0.9. (1)"
