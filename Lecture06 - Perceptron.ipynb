    "Multiclass classification using a linear neural network is a fairly simple extension of the binary classification setup.

Our labels are not necessarily linear, and halfway between $\\hat{y}=0$ and $\\hat{y}=2$ is not necessarily $\\hat{y}=1$. They are in fact categorical, and we use $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, K\\}$ out of computational convenience.\n",

So in this figure, we have $K=3$ classes, and 3 features, giving us 9 weights in total. In fact, this is the neural network view of multinomial logistic regression. Recall the previous likelihood used in binary logistic regression: $$ P(Y = y\\ |\\ X = \\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\left(-y\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}_i\\right)}$$ To extend this to $K$ classes, we use the following likelihood: $$ P(Y = k\\ |\\ X = \\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{w}_k^T\\mathbf{x}_i)}{\\sum_{k'}^K\\exp\\left(\\mathbf{w}_{k'}^T\\mathbf{x}_i\\right)}$$ The key difference is that there are now $K$ sets of $M$ weights, one for each label. These are specified when determining the likelihood for a particular $k$. By using this formalism, we ensure that the values produced by the output nodes forms a valid probability distribution, as we are normalizing the likelihood by summing over all values of $k$. \n",

We then continue backpropagating this error in the same fashion, all the way to the input. Backpropagation, much like forward propagation, is a recursive algorithm.

But we saw a pattern emerge in the last few sections - the error is propagated backwards through the network. In this section, we define the error signal, which is simply the accumulated error at each unit. For now, let's just consider the contribution of a single training instance (so we use $\\hat{y}$ instead of $\\hat{y}_i$). \n",

    "\n",

But for each unit $k$, we have $s_k = z_jw_{j\\rightarrow k}$, with each $s_k$ not depending on any other $s_k$. Therefore, we can use the chain rule again and sum over the output nodes $k\\in\\text{outs}(j)$: \n",
