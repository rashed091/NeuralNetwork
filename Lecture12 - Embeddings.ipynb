    "<h1 id=\"Word2Vec\">Word2Vec<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Word2Vec\">&#182;</a></h1><p>We use the tf-idf to transform a document into a vector. This vector can be seen as the weighted sum of <strong>one-hot vectors</strong> of distinct words in the document. The one-hot vectors for words have some limitations. For example, we know that \"cat\" is more similar to \"dog\" than \"cow\" semantically. However, the one-hot vectors of these three words has the same distance: 0. Can we embed words into a vector space that preserves the semantic distance between words?</p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Word2vec</strong> is an NN-based word embedding method. It is able to represent words in a continuous, low dimensional vector space (i.e., the embedding space) where semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points. The main idea of word2vec is to uses an NN with only <strong>1 linear hidden layer</strong> (i.e., each hidden unit has the linear activation function $a_j^{(1)}=z_j^{(1)}$) to use a word to predict its neighbors, as shown below:</p>\n",
    "<p><img src=\"images/fig-word2vec-sg.png\" width=\"350\"></p>\n",
    "<p>This is based on a key observation that <strong>semantically similar words are often used interchangeably in different contexts</strong>. For example, the words \"cat\" and \"dog\" may both appear in a context \"___ is my favorate pet.\" When feeding \"cat\" and \"dog\" into the NN to predict their nearby words, these two words will be likely to share the same/similar hidden representation ($\\boldsymbol{a}^{(1)}$ at layer 1) in order to predict the same/similar nearby words ($\\boldsymbol{a}^{(2)}$ at layer 2). After training the NN, we can use the weight matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}^{(1)}$ to encode a one-hot vector $\\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low dimensional dense vector $\\boldsymbol{h}$, by $\\boldsymbol{h}=\\boldsymbol{W}^{(1)\\top}\\boldsymbol{x}$.</p>\n",
    "<p>In the literature, the architecture of an word2vect NN comes in two flavors, the Continuous Bag-of-Words model (CBOW) and the skip-gram (SG) model.</p>\n",

    "<p>Algorithmically, these models are similar, except that CBOW predicts target words (e.g. \"cat\") from context words (\"is,\" \"my,\" \"favorite,\" and \"pet\"), while the skip-gram does the inverse and predicts context words from the target words. This inversion might seem like an arbitrary choice, but statistically it has the effect that CBOW smoothes over a lot of the distributional information (by treating an entire context as one example (C:[\"is,\" \"my,\" \"favorite,\" \"pet\"], T:\"cat\")). For the most part, this turns out to be a useful thing for smaller datasets. On the other hand, skip-gram treats each context-target pair (e.g., (T:\"cat\", C:\"pet\")) as a new observation and is shown to be able to capture the semantics better when we have a large dataset. We focus on the skip-gram model in the following.</p>\n",
    "<p>Note that the weights are shared across words to ensure that each word has a single embedding. This is called <strong>weight tying</strong>. Also, word2vec is a <strong>unsupervised learning</strong> task as it does not require explicit labels. An NN can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.</p>\n",

However, this objective introduces hight training cost when $V$ is large. Recall from the lecture that, at every training step in SGD, we need to compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to $\\boldsymbol{z}^{(L)}$. This gradient involves the $z_{i}^{(L)}$ of <strong>every unit</strong> at the output layer, which in turn leads to a lot of weight updates in $\\boldsymbol{W}^{(1)}$ and $\\boldsymbol{W}^{(2)}$ at every training step. The training will be very slow.</p>\n",
    "<h3 id=\"Negative-Sampling\">Negative Sampling<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Negative-Sampling\">&#182;</a></h3><p>To speed up the training process, we can instead replace the $V$ Softmax units at the output layer with $V$ Sigmoid units and use a new cost function:</p>\n",
    "$$\\arg\\min_{\\Theta}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left[-\\log\\mathrm{P}(y^{(i)}=1\\,|\\,\\boldsymbol{x}^{(i)},\\Theta)-\\sum_{j\\in\\mathbb{N}^{(i)}}\\log\\mathrm{P}(y^{(j)}=0\\,|\\,\\boldsymbol{x}^{(j)},\\Theta)\\right],$$<p>which amounts to:</p>\n",
    "$$\\arg\\min_{\\Theta}\\sum_{i}\\left[-\\log\\rho_{y^{(i)}}-\\sum_{j\\in\\mathbb{N}^{(i)}}\\log(1-\\rho_{y^{(j)}})\\right],$$<p>where $\\rho_{y^{(i)}}=\\sigma(z_{y^{(i)}}^{(L)})$ and $\\mathbb{N}^{(i)}$, $\\vert\\mathbb{N}^{(i)}\\vert=U\\ll N$, is a set of indexes of the <strong>noise words</strong> that have never been in the same context as the target word. The cost function is minimized when the model assigns high $\\rho_{y^{(i)}}$ to the context words, and low $\\rho_{y^{(j)}}$'s to all its noise words. It can be shown that the new model approximates the original one (with the softmax output units) when training on infinite examples. But the new model is computationally advantageous because the cost function involves only $O(U)$ attributes in $\\boldsymbol{z}^{(L)}$ (thus $O(U)$ output units). This leads to much less weight updates at each training step and higher efficiency.</p>\n",
    "<p>The above trick for improving the training efficiency in a multiclass classification task is called the <strong>negative sampling</strong>. Note that each example now contains one context word and additionally $U$ noise words. We need some extra preprocessing steps.</p>\n",
