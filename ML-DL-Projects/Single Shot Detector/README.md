# Single Shot Detector

In this project I implement a Single Shot Detection model with focal loss as detailed in [Focal loss for Dense Ojbect Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02002.pdf) 
to classify and localize objects. Image data used comes from 
Google's [Object Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-ai-open-images-object-detection-track).
