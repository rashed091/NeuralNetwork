# Movielens Recommender System

This project uses the [Movielens Data Set](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip) to build a collaborative
 filtering model. This model is then used to generate movie recommendations for users in the data set. The notebook also looks at scenarios
  for onboarding a new user with or without initial data on that user's movie tastes.
