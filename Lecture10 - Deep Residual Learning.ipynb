    "## Residual Learning\n",
    "It is possible to fit an desired underlying mapping $H(x)$ by a few stacked nonlinear layers, so they can also fit an another underlying mapping $F(x)=H(x)−x$. As a result, it is possible to reformulate it to $H(x)=F(x)+x$, which consists of the Residual Function $F(x)$ and input $x$. The connection of the input to the output is called a skipt connection or identity mapping. The general idea is that if multiple nonlinear layers can approximate the complicated function $H(x)$, then it is possible for them to approximate the residual function $F(x)$. Therefore the stacked layers are not used to fit $H(x)$, instead these layers approximate the residual function $F(x)$. Both forms should be able to fit the underlying mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/residual_building_block.png\" alt=\"\">\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason for the degradation problem could be the difficulties in approximating identity mappings by nonlinear layers. The reformulation used identity mapping as a reference and let the residual function represent the perturbations. The identity mapping can be generated by the solver through driving the weights of the residual function to zero if need be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "Residual learning is implented to every few stacked layers. Figure 2 shows an example of 2 layers. As an example, formulation (1) can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1)                                $$F(x)=W_2σ(W_1x)+x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where W1 and W2 are the weights for the convolutinoal layers and σ is the activation function, in this case a RELU function. The operation F+x is realized by a shortcut connection and element-wise addition. The addition is followed by an activation function σ.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting formulation for a residual block is:\n",
    "\n",
    "(2)                                $$y(x)=σ(W_2σ(W_1x)+x) .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After each convolution (weight) layer a batch normalization method (BN) is adopted. The training of the network is achiebed by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a mini-batch size of 256. The learning rate starts from 0.1 and is divided by 10 when the error plateaus. The weight decay rate is 0.0001 and has a value of 0.9. (1)"

    "### Plain Networks\n",

    "The plain networks are adopted from the VGG nets (Figure 3(left)). The convolutional layers have mostly 3x3 filters and the design follows two rules:\n",
    "1. For the same output feature map size, the layers have the same number of filters, and\n",
    "\n",
    "2. if the feature map size is halved, the number of filters is doubled in order to preserve the time complexity per layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downsampling operation is performed by the convolutional layers that have a stride of 2, hence no pooling layers. The network ends with a global average pooling layer and a 1000-way fully connected layer with softmax function.\n",

    "To convert the plain model to the residual version, shortcut connections are added, as demonstrated in the figure 3 (right). The solid line shortcuts are identity mapping. When the dimensions increases there are 2 options (dotted line shortcut):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The shortcut still performs identity mapping with zero padding to increasing the dimensions or\n",
    "\n",
    "2. the shortcut is used to match dimensions utilizing 1x1 convolution.\n",

    "In both options, when the shortcut go across feature maps of different sizes, they used a stride of 2. Generally the second option is used.(1)\n",
